## [CS 210 - Programming Languages](https://github.com/peck2703/CS_210_Portfolio)

**Course Description:**

Students will develop functional programs that comply with industry regulations and best practices using various programming 
languages. Special attention will be paid to the importance of developing code that is not only functional, but also secure, 
efficient, and professional.

**Portfolio Description:**

This project was created for high school level students to educate students in the ways of compound interest. By allowing 
the users to enter input values to calculate a rate of return when users add or don't add a monthly deposit. The program 
asks for an initial investment, a rate of interest compounded monthly, how many years the investment should calculate, and
an monthly deposit. The program then generates reports for as many years as the user requested with both monthly deposits 
and no monthly deposits

## [CS 230 - Operating Platforms](https://github.com/peck2703/CS_230_Portfolio)

**Course Description:**

Students will develop a deeper understanding of operating platforms and architectures through the analysis and evaluation of 
the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each. Students will learn the value of utilizing software design templates 
as well as how to utilize them to solve problems.

**Portfolio Description:**

The Gaming Room client wanted to take their existing game, Draw It or Lose, and expand it to cover multiple platforms and needed 
to review any new software requirements before expansion of new services. Currently the game app runs only on Android, but 
expansion plans include releasing the game on iOS as well, with potential plans to release on home consoles and PCs in the 
future.

## [CS 250 - Software Development Lifecycle](https://github.com/peck2703/CS250_Portfolio)

**Course Description:**

Students will explore the stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) through the lens of developers and testers 
to examine the characteristics, documentation, and purpose of each stage. Through applying SDLC stages within an agile 
development environment, students will learn the principles and best practices used to develop high quality software 
while also assessing the impact of communication, documentation, and ethics on the SDLC.

## [CS 255 - System Analysis and Design](https://github.com/peck2703/CS_255_Portfolio)

**Course Description:**

Students will explore the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that they can create system
models using appropriate industry tools. As a part of creating system models, students will also learn to effectively 
communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner.

**Portfolio Description:**

DriverPass is a company that wants to create a system that will be designed to improve the rate of success for road tests 
and wants to offer online and in-person training. Liam is the owner of the company and approached us with his vision for 
this system. They want a web-based application that allows users to register and be able to take online classes, or in-person
instruction and display all current progress on their main page along with any feedback from instructors.

## [CS 300 - Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design](https://github.com/peck2703/CS_300_Portfolio)

**Course Description:**

Students will develop code as well as use non-coding development methodologies in algorithmic design and problem solving. 
Students will use advanced algorithmic designs to evaluate complex data structures to aid in problem solving.

**Portfolio Description:**

A university has given you a csv file for a list of classes and it's prerequisites. Your job is to parse this csv file,
and create a data structure to hold data about each class and its information. Users must be able to load up a file, then
prompt the user to either print a list of all classes and its prerequisite(s) in alpha-numeric order, or to search for a 
specific class and it's prerequisite(s). The csv file is not formatted or sorted, so parsing the list must account for 
classes to "exist" before adding them to the data structure chosen (data structures allowed are vectors, hash tables, or a 
binary search tree).

## [CS 305 - Software Security](https://github.com/peck2703/CS_305_Software_Security)

**Course Description:**

Through the analysis of advanced security concepts, students will learn how to develop secure code that complies with security 
testing protocols. In addition to exploring and implementing security concepts through code, students will also learn why and 
how to apply encryption technologies and techniques to communicate securely.

**Portfolio Description:**

Artemis Financial has a web-based application that follows the RESTful framework, who is looking to apply the latest and most 
effective security methods for its application. Artemis Financial is looking to overcome any and all security vulnerabilities 
that can be identified and patched over.

## [CS 320 - Software Test, Automation QA](https://github.com/peck2703/CS_320_Software_Automation_Portfolio)

**Course Description:**

Students will apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development lifecycle, 
including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and analysis 
of various testing approaches will also be covered.

**Portfolio Description:**

Developing standardized classes and then writing JUnit tests alongside, providing as much coverage as can be expected given the
data type requested.
